# Cinema Web Application
### App is not an original made (!!!) using CinemaCity theme and logo

This is a web application made to develop my code skills based on OOP-concepts, Spring Boot Framework, Vue.js Framework, Map Struct, Lombok and Swagger libraries.
<br>Application uses same theme and logo of CinemaCity that are not under my trademark license.
